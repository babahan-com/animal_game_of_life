# animal_game_of_life

**Different view on Conways game_of_life in which animal only live if they have something to eat (grass for example)

## Rules

- 1 stands for grass (green)
- 2 stands for animal which eats grass to be alive (blue)
- 0 stands for dead zone (white). It can be viewed as a desert
  - Animals live and reproduce only if they eat grass and have access to it
  - Grass multiplies too, but only if there are other grass blocks
  
## How it works
